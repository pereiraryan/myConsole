# myConsole

A JavaScript editor for you phone, in JavaScript.

A live version of it is hosted [here](https://victorribeiro.com/myConsole).

You can add it to your phone as an app, if you want to; just click menu / add to your homescreen.

## How to use it

Type the code on the textarea.

```javascript
console.log( 1 );
```

First button clear the page and the cache with the code.

Second button runs the code.

As said above, your code is stored in cache, so you don't loose it.


## To Do

Add a download button - to save the code as *file.js*.

Add a share button - to share via e-mail, whatsapp... a code solution with your friends (or classmates).

Do the above things without disturbing the minimalist design.
